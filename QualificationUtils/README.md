## Development

### Building from Source

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `QualificationUtils.sln` in Visual Studio
3. **Configure your TPH installation path** (see Configuration section below)
4. Build the solution
5. The mod will automatically build to your TPH mods directory

### Configuration

#### Setting Your TPH Installation Path

**IMPORTANT**: Before building, you must update the TPH installation path in the project file to match your system.

**File**: `QualificationUtils/QualificationUtils.csproj`  
**Lines to edit**: 22-23

```xml
<TPHRootFolder>D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\TPH</TPHRootFolder>
<ModsFolder>$(TPHRootFolder)\Mods\QualificationUtils</ModsFolder>
```

**Change the path on line 22** to match your Two Point Hospital installation:

**Common Steam paths:**

- **Steam (C: drive)**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\TPH`
- **Steam (D: drive)**: `D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\TPH`
- **Steam (E: drive)**: `E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\TPH`
- **Steam (F: drive)**: `F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\TPH`

**Epic Games Store paths:**

- **Epic (C: drive)**: `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\TPH`
- **Epic (D: drive)**: `D:\Epic Games\TPH`

**Example for your system:**
If your TPH is installed at `C:\Games\TwoPointHospital`, change line 22 to:

```xml
<TPHRootFolder>C:\Games\TwoPointHospital</TPHRootFolder>
```

**Line 23 will automatically update** since it references the `TPHRootFolder` variable.

#### What Gets Built Where

After configuration, the build process will:

- **Source files**: Compiled from `QualificationUtils/` folder
- **Output location**: `[YourTPHPath]\Mods\QualificationUtils\`
- **Files included**: `QualificationUtils.dll`, `Info.json`, and all dependencies

#### DLL References and Dependencies

**IMPORTANT**: The project references several DLLs from your TPH installation. These paths are automatically updated when you change the `TPHRootFolder`, but you should verify they're correct.

**File**: `QualificationUtils/QualificationUtils.csproj`  
**Lines**: 45-75 (Reference section)

**All DLL references use the `$(TPHRootFolder)` variable, so they automatically update when you change line 22:**

```xml
<!-- Harmony12 - Runtime patching library -->
<Reference Include="Harmony12">
  <HintPath>$(TPHRootFolder)\TPH_Data\Managed\UnityModManager\0Harmony12.dll</HintPath>
  <Private>False</Private>
</Reference>

<!-- Game assembly files -->
<Reference Include="Assembly-CSharp">
  <HintPath>$(TPHRootFolder)\TPH_Data\Managed\Assembly-CSharp.dll</HintPath>
  <Private>False</Private>
</Reference>

<Reference Include="Assembly-CSharp-firstpass">
  <HintPath>$(TPHRootFolder)\TPH_Data\Managed\Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll</HintPath>
  <Private>False</Private>
</Reference>

<!-- Unity engine modules -->
<Reference Include="UnityEngine">
  <HintPath>$(TPHRootFolder)\TPH_Data\Managed\UnityEngine.dll</HintPath>
  <Private>False</Private>
</Reference>

<Reference Include="UnityEngine.CoreModule">
  <HintPath>$(TPHRootFolder)\TPH_Data\Managed\UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll</HintPath>
  <Private>False</Private>
</Reference>

<Reference Include="UnityEngine.IMGUIModule">
  <HintPath>$(TPHRootFolder)\TPH_Data\Managed\UnityEngine.IMGUIModule.dll</HintPath>
  <Private>False</Private>
</Reference>

<Reference Include="UnityEngine.TextRenderingModule">
  <HintPath>$(TPHRootFolder)\TPH_Data\Managed\UnityEngine.TextRenderingModule.dll</HintPath>
  <Private>False</Private>
</Reference>

<!-- Unity Mod Manager -->
<Reference Include="UnityModManager">
  <HintPath>$(TPHRootFolder)\TPH_Data\Managed\UnityModManager\UnityModManager.dll</HintPath>
</Reference>
```

**What this means:**

- **Only change line 22** (`TPHRootFolder`) - all DLL paths update automatically
- **All DLLs are located in**: `[YourTPHPath]\TPH_Data\Managed\`
- **Harmony and UMM are in**: `[YourTPHPath]\TPH_Data\Managed\UnityModManager\`
- **Game assemblies are in**: `[YourTPHPath]\TPH_Data\Managed\`

**If you have a non-standard TPH installation structure**, you may need to manually adjust individual DLL paths on lines 45-75.

#### Verification Steps

1. **Check your TPH installation path** by looking in Steam/Epic for the game location
2. **Update line 22** in `QualificationUtils.csproj` with the correct path
3. **Build the solution** - you should see output going to your TPH mods folder
4. **Verify the build** by checking `[YourTPHPath]\Mods\QualificationUtils\` contains the mod files
